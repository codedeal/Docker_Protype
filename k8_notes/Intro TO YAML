 DICTIONARY VS LIST VS LIST of DICTIONARY -- When to use
A car is a single object and it has properties such as color, model, transition and price, to store different
information or properties of a single object. We use a dictionary in this simple dictionary.

but now we need to split model into further details like modelname ,year In this case the single value of model is now replaced by a small dictionary with two properties name
So this is a dictionary within another dictionary.

Now we have six car we use List of Cars

if we want to store information about each car so we turn list inot list of dictionaries

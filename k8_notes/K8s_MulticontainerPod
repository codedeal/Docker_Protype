As Discussed in earlier section we said that PODS usually have a one-to-one relationship with the
containers, but, are we restricted to having a single container in a single POD?

A: No a single POD CAN have multiple containers, except for the fact that they are usually not
multiple containers of the same kind. 

We know that if we want to scale our application up we increase number of pods but many times
you might have a scenario were you have a helper container (a container with Main one)
that might be doing some kind of supporting task for our web application such as
processing a user entered data, processing a file uploaded by the user etc. and you
want these helper containers to live along side your application container. In that
case, you CAN have both of these containers part of the same POD, so that when a
new application container is created, the helper is also created and when it dies the
helper also dies since they are part of the same POD.The two containers can also
communicate with each other directly by referring to each other as ‘localhost’ since
they share the same network namespace. Plus they can easily share the same storage
space as well.

#Note MultiContianer POD share 1. Network and 2. Storage
Types Of MultiContainer PODS or design pattern of multi container 
1. Ambassador
2. Adapter
3. SideCar

First One is Side Car
To create a multi-container pod, add the new container information to the poddefinition file. 
Remember, the containers section under the spec section in a pod definition file is
an array and the reason it is an array is to allow multiple containers in
a single POD.

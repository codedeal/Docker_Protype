Q:Why we need replica
A:Let's assume that we have a single POD running our application.
What if for some reason our application crashes and the POD fails?

Users will no longer be able to access our application. To prevent 
users from losing access to our application we would have multiple
instance or POD of same application thus this provide high availibilty
and scalability

Now what if it for some reason we have a single pod it fail
the RController will help to bring back it alive

Other Reason we need it for Load balanceing and Scalaing

Can't get any of this please explain .....
Let's take example by running below docker command

docker run hello-world

This command meant that we wants to start a new container using image hello-world
what happened here

1. Started Docker CLI
2. Give this Command to Docker Server
3. Docker server if its has a local copy in image cache if not present it reach out to docker hub
4. from docker hub it download image 
5. store image locally in image cache
6. after getting image docker server run the instance of image or create container out of it

 Container is a set of process with a group of assigned resources
 
DOCKER Run

docker run image_iname

1. Image gets into container assigned hard drive
2. then we execute command into running process of container
   ==============================================
   Docker ps - specifically show running container
   ===============================================

docker ps

show list of all container only running one
It contains following information
Container_ID, Image, Command, Created Status, Ports


docker run = docker create + docker start

Difference b/w create and start a container:

Create container - it just placing the snapshot of image in hard disk
to actually Start Container-  we execute the start up command and put it in running process

Docker start vs docker run
by default docker run show you all logs
but docker start not show you this logs

docker system prune
======================
delete all thing even cache 

Stop a Container 
docker stop container_id
=======================
kill a Container 
docker kill container_id
=========================
Whats difference between the two

stop ->SIGTERM (message to terminate)->Container (it means it tell the container shut down 
at your own time when you are comfortable )->stop process inside container and release resources

Kill -> SIGKILL->Container->(it means shut down right now )

docker stop has only 10 seconds to close container if its 
fails the job would be delegated to docker kill

What is MultiCommand Containers?

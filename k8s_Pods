Pods

The containers are encapsulated into a Kubernetes object
known as PODs. A POD is a single instance of an application. 
A POD is the smallest object, that you can create in kubernetes. 

One Pod - One containers (1to1 relationship)is what prefered but you can have helper contianers
To Scale up - add new pods
To Scale down - delete new pods
if Node capicity reached we add new node

A Pod can have additional container must it must be not of same kind 
means a helper container

Two contianer talk to each other using network

K8s Architecture:
Node - it is a machine physical or virtual machine on which k8s is installed it is a worker machine and this is where 
the containers will be launched
Also known as Minion

Problem - what if node fails ?
Ans - the application on that node also fails
Soln - have multiple Node or Cluster

What is Cluster?
It is a group on Node .. or a set of Node and on each node your application is runing
it also helps in load sharing among different nodes

Problem - who will manage this cluster means who will decide how many node are up and report when a node fails then
how it move workload from one node to other
Soln- Master it is just another node with configuration information and its responsible for orchestration of container on
the worker nodes.
